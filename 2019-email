Hi all!

It’s only less bit more than a month until CodeFreeze 2012! What a wonderful time to meet you all, again. To see (some) of the participants,  https://codefreeze.fi/#participants. Why some - because I know people that are coming and have not "registered" via the web page. Which is totally fine. One reason for the PR based registration is to get this email.

*****
This year, Esko Luontola improved the web site with information on how to register - it's super important to email Kiilopää, the venue, to secure yourselves a spot there. Yet, if that did not happen, we would find place to stay for every one of us! So, please do that by sending email to kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi.

To stay in touch now that we are approaching the event, you can choose to join the Software Crafters Slack. You can invite yourself via http://slack.softwarecrafters.org
Then join the #codefreeze_fi channel. This will be the primary Point of Contact - and any other works, too.

We have set up a Trello board, which you can join with this link:

To see what the previous year had to offer, there is a link on the conference web page to Trello boards since 2017

If you have anything on your mind, please do not hesitate to ask!

The second most important thing FOOD:
There are 2 good options: 
1) preorder a full board for your stay - you'll get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the venue - please remember to mention any special dietary constraints to  the hotel, kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi 
2) cook your own food. There is at least 1 cabin cooking all themselves, and I'm sure they are more than willing to join forces on this. I am with my car, so getting to supermarket is doable, at least every second day.


How to arrive to the venue?
A Trello card:  https://trello.com/c/Umf7mmb5/24-make-travel-arrangements

What to expect?
 - CodeFreeze is an unconference which is nearly entirely run by you, the participants. Typically there are 3-4 days of conference mixed with a lot of outdoor activities.
 - We will start with a marketplace where everyone can introduce themselves and share the topics or questions they brought. Please add them to the Trello so everyone can participiate and mark their interest by joining a card.
 - Because of the short daylight we focus on the outdoor activities in the morning (~1000-1500),  the conference sessions happen when most are back. Please remember: you decide when the time  is right for a session, an activity, a nap, or ... Smoke Sauna!
 - This is what you don't want to miss! On Monday, we have a private sauna only for us. And there is a hot tub right next to the sauna - or how would you call water that might be up to 20*C hotter than the air?

What to bring with you:
 * There is a packing list, made up by codefreeze regulars, in the Trello: https://trello.com/c/RtEt4YLr/1-packing-list

WIFI:
 * There is wifi at the main hall. It might work at the hotel rooms, but not in the cabins.
 * Since we’re in Finland, a land with proper cellular coverage, there is a good 4G coverage.

All the best and see you soon!
