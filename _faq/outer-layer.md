For outer layer, it's enough that it is wind resistant. And maybe cozy enough to wear. I typically don't wear anything super expensive GoreTex jackets/trousers. In winter, I myself have both [soft shell jacket, like](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/softshell-takit/gecko-hood/) and [an anorak, like](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/retkeilytakit/gutulia-anorak/). I use an anorak when skiing, and a soft shell jacket when snowboarding. Why - I don't really know. 

Anyway, the most important thing is, that it should be wind resistant. At least if planning to do any physical exercise above the tree level.
