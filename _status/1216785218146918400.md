A perfect day at #codefreeze : lots of nice views during a ski hike (the light here is amazing), a refactoring session alongside coffee and squeaky cheese, then back and forth between the smoke sauna and the dip. Now chilling amongst amazing folks before diner üòç

Now it got even better: I wrote up the couple of sessions I was thinking about.
And... we're cooking pancake over an open fire!

And to cap the day, 3 sessions in the same room tonight: more refactoring, knitting and lock picking (and there were others elsewhere üôÇ).
I love variety üòç
