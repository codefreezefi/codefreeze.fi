Hi all!

It’s only less bit more than a month until CodeFreeze 2022! What a wonderful time to meet you all, again. To see (some) of the participants, https://codefreeze.fi/#participants. Why some - because I know people that are coming and have not "registered" via the web page. Which is totally fine. One reason for the PR based registration is to get this email. Please read the next 3 chapter, at least. They are the most important ones.

## Accommodation

Please make sure you have book accommodation directly from Kiilopää! By getting this email, I know you have created a pull request, or I just happen to know you are joining. The reason for the PR is only to get this email. You join the group by booking a stay for yourself.

## Corona

Here is a link to official page on travelling to Finland: https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/entry-restrictions

The latest updates about Corona in Finland can be found from: https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates

In short: to travel to Finland, we need either vaccination, recovery or PCR test.

Also, please consider what needs of yours, regarding the corona situation, you'd like to find met at Codefreeze. And also if you happen to have any requests - or favorite strategies to meet those needs. You can then either approach either me or Markus, or talk in the Slack, for example.

I hope we’ll all make our make the time at Codefreeze as safe as possible for us - and for that, it would be nice to be prepared. And with that, please bring COVID self tests to use them at the location, if symptoms develop.

## Code of Conduct

Please remember the code of conduct for our time at Kiilopää: https://codefreeze.fi/#code-of-conduct

## Stay in touch

To stay in touch now that we are approaching the event, you can choose to join the Software Crafters Slack. You can invite yourself via https://slack.softwarecrafters.org

Then join the `#codefreeze_fi` channel. This will be the primary Point of Contact - and any other works, too.

We have set up a Trello board, which you can join with this link: https://trello.com/b/gIa0sgnT/codefreeze-2022

To see what the previous year had to offer, there is a link on the conference web page to Trello boards since 2017.

If you have anything on your mind, please do not hesitate to ask!

## Food

The next most important thing FOOD:

There are 2 good options:

1. preorder a full board for your stay - you'll get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the venue - please remember to mention any special dietary constraints to the hotel, kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi

2. cook your own food. Contact Markus if you want to join the vegan cooking group. I am with my car, so getting to supermarket is doable, at least every second day.

## How to get there

How to arrive to the venue? - a bus is driving from Ivalo airport to Suomen Latu Kiilopää (on all flights waits for everyone to arrive)

- add your time & date to Trello - know who to meet at the bus, or at the venue
-
- there will be familiar faces on most planes to Kiilopää - so probably already on the bus to Kiilopää, there will be codefreeze participants.

## What to expect?

- CodeFreeze is an unconference which is nearly entirely run by you, the participants. Typically there are 3-4 days of conference mixed with a lot of outdoor activities.

- We will start with a marketplace where everyone can introduce themselves and share the topics or questions they brought. Please add them to the Trello so everyone can participiate and mark their interest by joining a card.

- Because of the short daylight we focus on the outdoor activities in the morning (~1000-1500), the conference sessions happen when most are back. Please remember: you decide when the time is right for a session, an activity, a nap, or ... Smoke Sauna!

- This is what you don't want to miss! On Monday, we have a private sauna only for us. And there is a hot tub right next to the sauna - or how would you call water that might be up to 20\*C hotter than the air?

## What to bring

- There is a packing list, made up by codefreeze regulars, in the Trello: https://trello.com/c/PLllUJuf

- Also read ‘What to Bring’ from the site: https://codefreeze.fi/#what-to-bring-with-you

  - COVID self tests

  - swimming suit

  - backpack (that you can carry while skiing in -20C)

  - thermos (having warm juice when outdoors is so nice to have)

## WiFi

- There is wifi at the main hall. It might work at the hotel rooms, but not in the cabins.

- Since we’re in Finland, a land with proper cellular coverage, there is a good 4G coverage.

All the best to you all,
Aki
