## {{page.tagline}}

Codefreeze is an unconference with very little structure. Actually, it’s not a conference at all. Codefreeze is a _time_ and _place_ for software craftspeople to meet. We would like to have likeminded people to gather in one place and have long conversations about our craft over a drink. And to practice our coding skills.

While most sessions happen from Monday to Friday, participants typically spend a full week in Kiilopää to enjoy the amazing winter nature and activities.

This year, we’ll experience new moon - time when the moon does not _enlighten us_, but hopefully gives more room for Aurora Borealis to do that.

Did we mention that this place is above the arctic circle? Which is pretty cool. Or _freezingly cold actually_.

### <a name="trello"></a>Sessions

To get an idea of what happens at Codefreeze, you can find the conference schedules on Trello. Most _Codefreeze_ topics (green) have additional information in links in the cards.

The Trello board is also used for coordinating travel arrangements and planning the next Codefreeze, so it's good to check it out in advance.

## Why?

### Winter? Really?

Have you ever been coding under the northern lights? Or in a Lapp daylight? Early-mid February is one of the best times to see northern lights in action. And it also happens, that there's a full moon during the stay. We've done what we can - provide best possible time for some extraordinary experiences.

We know it might be rather cold. Temperatures down to -25°C are normal at the time of the year. For some clothing tips, see the [FAQ](#faq).

### Smoke sauna?

Being in Lapland in the winter, and one of the most important things is to have a decent sauna. And we do. There's a big enough smoke sauna to have probably up to 30 programmers. And possibility for winter swimming on a relaxing little stream.

### Want to relax a bit while coding?

Luckily, nature is at the core of Kiilopää. And not only that, Kiilopää provides daily trips to nearby fells guided by experienced nature guides. For example, there's a snow shoe trip on Wednesday morning.

## Accommodation

### How to make the reservation?

Book your stay in Kiilopää yourself by email to [kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi](mailto:kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi) and mention “Codefreeze” for the discount and to get a room/cabin from the reserved slots.

### And what does it cost?

The prices include _stay_, _breakfast_, _lunch_, _dinner_ and (most probably) _smoke sauna_ on Monday or Tuesday:

- For [single bed room](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accomodation/hotel-niilanpaa/): 92 € / person / night
- For [double](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accomodation/hotel-niilanpaa/) 70 € / person / night
- For a [wilderness cabin](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accomodation/cabins/) 105 € / cabin / night + 39€ / person / day for the meals
- For a [log cabin](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accomodation/cabins/) (very suitable for families): 120 € / cabin / night + 39€ / person / day

### About the cabins

All cabins are non-smoking; pets are allowed.

#### Wilderness cabin

Our small but cosy (30 square meters) log cabins are well suited for 2-4 persons. Each cabin has one large room with two bunk beds and a tv-set, kitchen area (fridge, electric stove, microwave oven, coffee maker, set of dishes), sauna/shower, bathroom and a drying cabinet for clothes.

#### Log cabin

The log cabins are a bit bigger than the wilderness cabins (44 square meters each). A log cabin accommodates max. 2+2 persons. Each cabin has a bedroom (2 x 80 cm beds), living room (with a sofa bed for two, fireplace, tv-set) and an open kitchen area (with coffee maker, electric stove, microwave oven, fridge), electric sauna/shower and a bathroom. The dining table seats four. There is also a drying cabinet for clothes and small outdoor storage in the cabin.

### About Food

Folks have 2 good options: either

- book full board that includes breakfast, lunch and dinner, or
- prepare own meals at the cottages. Aki will be at the venue by car, so he can bring some food on the way, and folks can get to local supermarket daily.

Normally lunch and dinner is not vegetarian. If you prefer vegetarian food, or have food allergies, please contact the hotel and tell your preferences.

## What to bring with you:

- swimming suit / trunk (for the smoke sauna). And if you prefer the german/swiss way to be in Sauna, own towel might be handy
- a nice and handy backpack, 20-40l (this is very handy for day treks organised by Kiilopää)
- a bottle of 1l - a thermos would be nice if you have one. Again, for the day treks. For the warm juice to drink.
- warm clothes, spare gloves, etc.
- a camera might be good, if we have a chance to see the auroras (Tripod, extra batteries, etc.)
- cash: not so much - you can use credit card basically for everything in Finland.

For more detailed information on clothes see the [FAQ](#faq).

## <a name="kiilopaa"></a>Kiilopää: a magical place in Lapland

[Kiilopää Fell Center](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en) in Lapland is an ideal place to get in touch with the Nordic wilderness. At Kiilopää you can conquer a fell, dip into an ice-cold lake, and ski under the Northern Lights. Or you can just sit back and enjoy the surrounding natural beauty, sense the arctic peace and quiet, and listen to exotic Lapland stories by the fireplace.

Kiilopää is owned by Suomen Latu, the Outdoor Association of Finland. Suomen Latu is a promoter of outdoor activities, an expert in hiking and an organisation which is open to all. The main objective of Suomen Latu has always been to increase Finnish people’s interest in exercise as well as developing possibilities for outdoor, conditioning and recreational exercise. Nowadays guarding everyman’s right has become more and more important.

_For more information see the [official Kiilopää web site](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en)._

## <a name="directions"></a>How to get here

### By plane

The nearest airport is in Ivalo (IVL). Both Finnair and Norwegian flies from Helsinki to Ivalo, if not daily, then almost. There are also some direct flights to Frankfurt, London and other places. Find out about the flight schedule.

For every single flight arriving at Ivalo, there is a [bus connection from the Ivalo airport to Kiilopää](https://liput.matkahuolto.fi/connectionlist?lang=en&departurePlaceId=p2120&arrivalPlaceId=s1963#breadcrumb).

### By train

Take the earlier night train from southern Finland to Rovaniemi. From Rovaniemi there is a [bus connection from the Rovaniemi railway station to Kiilopää](https://www.matkahuolto.fi/).

## Activities

### Have you done _The Dip_?

The Sauna World of Kiilopää is called Kuurakaltio. There are two electric saunas with dressing rooms and showers, as well as a traditional Finnish smoke sauna. There are separate sauna facilities for men and women.

Have you ever been winter swimming? It is an experience when the air temperature is around -20 ºC while the water is -1 ºC. You might want to dip into the refreshing waters of Kiilopuro fell brook. And if feeling really crazy, why not to take a fresh start in the morning?

During Codefreeze, the smoke sauna is heated on Tuesday on Wednesday, and on Tuesday we have a private sauna from 3pm-6pm.

_More information about [the smoke sauna in Kiilopää](https://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/outdoor-activities/smoke-sauna.html)._

### Spending some time at Kiilopää?

As folks found out on Codefreeze 2015, the scenery is beautiful and there are a lot of interesting things to do, outside the realms of talking software. Suomen Latu Kiilopää organizes amazing safaris for all guests, for example

#### Searching for Northern Lights

a guided trip with snow shoes to nearby fells in the late evening to see the fantastic Aurora Borealis.

#### On a Reindeer Trek

A reindeer caravan has been harnessed for you in the reindeer yard ready for your journey into the silent wilderness. Guided by an original Sámi reindeer herder, you will drive your own reindeer along the journey. The reindeer will take you across the enchanting snowy white scenery. The frost glistens like diamonds on the shoulders of the pine trees. You sit warmly and comfortably on reindeer skins in a sleigh. Reindeer bells gently ring as their hooves crunch through the snow. When the reindeer caravan returns to the yard, the experience of a warm “kota” awaits you. Enjoy some hot drink while a reindeer herder gladly tells you stories of his life in the wilds of Lapland. Transfer to and from reindeer farm.

#### Searching for Northern Lights on a Reindeer Trek

Reindeer caravan will take you in to the woods. Moon and stars will guide your way and the silence of wilderness will around you. Hot drinks and stories about reindeer in the kota after the sleigh ride. Transfer to and from reindeer farm.

#### And More

- Husky Safaris
- Snowmobile Safari to Wilderness
- Aurora Borealis Safari by Snowmobiles
- Fishing Experience by Snowmobile
- Snowmobile Safari to Reindeer Farm
