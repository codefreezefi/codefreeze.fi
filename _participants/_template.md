## What to wear 
 * That's the most important part. Second most important is what to wear (clothes) in winter Lapland. Temperatures might get down to -30C (which is quite cold), but -15C is surprisingly warm - or at least not-so-cold up north.  I have written a faq, that basically is not visible in the site (yet): http://www.codefreeze.fi/faq/ . Also notice the sections are in wrong order, apparently.

Reading that, you might notice a trend: I mostly wear merino wool when I'm in Lapland. Also, from the first year, we found out that jeans are not really warm for the outmost layer.

## boots
There is 60-100cm snow on the ground. I highly encourage to wear boots which cover your ankles. Especially important if you plan to take a snowshoe trek.

## What to bring with you:
 * swimming suit / trunk (for the smoke sauna). And if you prefer the german/swiss way to be in Sauna, own towel might be handy 
 * a nice and handy backpack, 20-40l (this is very handy for day treks organised by Kiilopää)
 * a bottle of 1l - a thermos would be nice if you have one. Again, for the day treks. For the warm juice to drink.
 * warm clothes, spare gloves, etc.
 * a camera might be good, if we have a chance to see the auroras (Tripod, extra batteries, etc.)
 * cash: not so much - you can use credit card basically for everything in Finland.

## WIFI:
 * There is wifi at the main hall. It might work at the single/double rooms, but not in the cabins.
 * Since we’re in Finland, a land with proper cellular coverage, there is a 4G base station at the main hall. Own SIM cards for local operator (DNA) can be organised

## and a bit longer version:

Codefreeze is a very special event, at very special time in a very specific place. It’s less of a conference and more holiday with a twist of geekiness and conferencing. During the last 3 years, we have been mostly enjoying the Lapp winter wonderland - weather and scenery - during the day and done some conferencing (and aurora watching) during the nights. 

Having said that out loud - family members and friends are more than welcome. Folks do not need to work in IT to be able to join the event!

The dates for 2018 are, again, rather vague. Semi-officially the dates are Jan 15th - Jan 17th 2018, but as I normally state this. “I typically say some dates when there will be, most probably, people interested in software”. 
That said - some are staying longer while other the 3 days.

For example I myself booked a cottage from Friday Jan 12th to The Jan 18th - but I’m also planning to stay one extra night in a nearby (~10km) shelter, enjoying the quietness and northern lights. 

For next year, we have our own little private smoke sauna on Monday evening (like always). And on every other night, we have sauna in some of the many cabins. And there is the dip.

I was asked a couple of times how about family members and/or kids. They all are more than welcome! The place is good for families and there are lots of interesting things to do also with kids. Last year, my kids and my friends’ kids (aged from 1.5, 3, 7 and 10) so enjoyed the snow and everything you can do in the snow. 
The weather can, though, be quite harsh especially for the little ones: if it is close to -25C, it is quite cold and you can stay outdoors only some time before needing to go back indoors. When Joona (our little one) was 2 at codefreeze we did spend quite some time indoors - mainly because of the coldness. Last year that was not such a big deal anymore.


## last words
as we know from previous years, you don't really need to "register" - booking your stay, showing up and knowing the discount code does the magic.
