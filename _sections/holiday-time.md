As folks found out on [codefreeze 2015](2015), the scenery is beautiful and there would be tons of interesting things to do, outside the realms of talking software. Suomen Latu Kiilopää organizes quite interesting set of safaris for all people. The possible safaris include, for example


 * <h3>SEARCHING FOR NORTHERN LIGHTS</h3>
	a guided trip with snow shoes to nearby fells in the late evening to see the fantastic Aurora Borealis.
 * <h3>ON A REINDEER TREK</h3>
	*A reindeer caravan has been harnessed for you in the reindeer yard ready for your journey into the
silent wilderness. Guided by an original Sámi reindeer herder, you will drive 
your own reindeer along the journey. The reindeer will take you across the 
enchanting snowy white scenery. The frost glistens like diamonds on the 
shoulders of the pine trees. You sit warmly and comfortably on reindeer skins 
in a sleigh. Reindeer bells gently ring as their hooves crunch through the 
snow. When the reindeer caravan returns to the yard, the experience of a 
warm “kota” awaits you. Enjoy some hot drink while a reindeer herder gladly 
tells you stories of his life in the wilds of Lapland. Transfer to and from 
reindeer farm.*
 * <h3>SEARCHING FOR NORTHERN LIGHTS ON A REINDEER TREK</h3>
*Reindeer caravan will take you in to the woods. Moon and stars will guide your way and the silence of 
wilderness will around you. Hot drinks and stories about reindeer in the kota after the sleigh ride. 
Transfer to and from reindeer farm.*
