### Winter? Really?

Have you ever been coding under the northern lights? Or in a Lapp daylight? Early-mid February is one of the best times to see northern lights in action. And it also happens, that there's a full moon during the stay. We've done what we can - provide best possible time for some extraordinary experiences.

### Smoke sauna?

Being in Lapland in the winter, and one of the most important things is to have a decent sauna. And we do. There's a big enough smoke sauna to have probably up to 30 programmers. And possibility for winter swimming on a relaxing little stream.

### Want to relax a bit while coding?

Luckily, nature is at the core of Kiilopää. And not only that, Kiilopää provides daily trips to nearby fells guided by experienced nature guides. For example, there's a snow shoe trip on Wednesday morning.
