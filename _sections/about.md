Codefreeze is a unconference with very little structure.
Actually, it's not a conference at all.
CodeFreeze is a _time_ and _place_ for software craftspeople to meet.
We would like to have likeminded people to gather in one place and have long conversations about craftmanship over a beer.
And to practice our coding skills.

Did we mention that this place is above the arctic circle? Which is pretty cool.
Or _freezingly cold actually_.
